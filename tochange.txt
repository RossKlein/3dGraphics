things to change:
-how information is passed to the Opengl rendering pipeline. In order to send a model to the GPU I have to recalculate
all the matrices because I have no good system to handle this common need. There is also no coordinate or chunk system
 which would facilitate placing objects in the world.

 -how I can switch between different scenes. The scene system is extremely barebones and is not really usable in the way
  it is intended. It should be able to seamlessly switch between different scenes, such as a title screen, a menu, or a
   render.

-how models are stored in those scenes. Similar to point one, One upgrade would be working on a better model system which
 handles the tasks that, at the time, I did not know needed to be handled.

 -MAKE FUCKING STATIC METHODS INSTEAD OF CREATING NEW OBJECTS FOR EVERY FUCKING MATRIX AND CALCULATION

 -flesh out sceneshading to actually handle the matrices
 -
